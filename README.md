# Railseat Finder

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

About --> A Flutter project as a assignment for CRUV. Basically it inputs a seat number and lets to find which type of seat and where you are getting in Indian Railways.

* This app is built in 3 days and mostly i worked in UI because I think for best User-Experience UI plays a major role.
* This app uses State management of "BLOC" to implement the data and it states and events.
* It inputs your seat number and shows corresponding seat according to Indian Railways system.
* It shows invalid error when wrong type of seat number is inputed with "AUTO DELETE" feature of invalid seat number.
